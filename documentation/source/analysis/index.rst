Analysis & measurement
**********************

In the last step of the tutorial, we constructed a simple debate containing two 
arguments. `taupy` can analyse its debate object in a variety of ways, by 
measuring:

1. distances between positions and agreement between them
2. degrees of justification
3. dialectical density
4. different concepts of polarisation
5. graph objects
