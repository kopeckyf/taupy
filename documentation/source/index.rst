taupy?
------

taupy is a Python package for the study of dialectical structures. The theory
of dialectical structures is an argumentation framework for the study of human,
artificial and abstract argumentation and debate.

With taupy, you can analyse, represent, and simulate debates as well as the
behaviour of artificial agents in debates. However, the package is not aimed at
the study of individual, real-world debates: it is not a debate reconstruction 
tool, and has only rudimentary tools for visualisation. For these purposes, you
could have a look at `Argdown <https://argdown.org>`_.

About this documentation
------------------------

This documentation is organised into three parts: A user guide, some example
tutorials, which show taupy in combination with other packages (e.g. statistical
analysis, community/clustering algorithms), and a technical source code 
documentation for those interested in the inner workings of the package.

If you'd like to report an issue or file a feature request, please open an
issue in `taupy's GitHub repository <https://github.com/kopeckyf/taupy>`_. 
There's also a change log and release history on GitHub.

Besides the content in this documentation, there are some special pages: 
The :ref:`genindex` and the :ref:`modindex` and the :ref:`modules`.
