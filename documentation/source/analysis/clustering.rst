Clustering belief systems
=========================

Clustering is a pre-condition for some diversity and polarisation measures. 
Belief systems in the theory of dialectical structures are clustered by comparing
their distances to other agents. Intuitively, clusters should be formed by groups
that have low mutual distance. This means that clustering is dependent on a 
distance function.

Generate clustering matrices
----------------------------

The clustering algorithms accept a :py:obj:`clustering_matrix` as input, which is
generated by :py:func:`clustering_matrix`:

.. autofunction:: taupy.analysis.clustering.clustering_matrix

Clustering algorithms
---------------------

:py:mod:`taupy` implements four clustering functions. These functions serve as
frontends to the clustering algorithms in :py:mod:`igraph` and :py:mod:`sklearn`.

.. autofunction:: taupy.analysis.clustering.leiden
.. autofunction:: taupy.analysis.clustering.affinity_propagation
.. autofunction:: taupy.analysis.clustering.agglomerative_clustering
.. autofunction:: taupy.analysis.clustering.density_based_clustering

Comparing clusterings
---------------------

The adjusted Rand index (ARI, [HubertArabie1985]_) measures the similarity 
between two clusterings. For simulations that contain many debate stages, the 
ARI can indicate whether the clustering in subsequent debate stages has 
completely changed or is somewhat stable. A reasonably high ARI can support the
reliability of the clustering method for the analysed debate stages.
