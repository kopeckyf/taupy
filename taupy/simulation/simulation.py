class Simulation(list, SimulationBase):
    """
    A simulation in which agents introduce new arguments bit by bit. 
    For historic reasons, this kind of simulation bears the generic name.

    :param bool directed: 
        Boolean indicating whether purposeful argument introductions are requested.
        If set to False, random arguments that do not take into account agents'
        belief systems are introduced.

    :param debate_growth: 
        Can be either of :py:obj:`"random"` or :py:obj:`"treelike"`. Random
        debate growth leads to argument maps that are like random graphs. 
        Tree-like debate growth leads to maps that are hierarchical, tree-like
        structures. The latter require specification of :py:attr:`key_statements`,
        as the roots of the tree need to be specified.

    :param dict events:
        A mapping of events to their chance of occuring. Recognised events
        are :py:obj:`"introduction"` and :py:obj:`"new_sentence"`.  

    :param sentencepool: 
        The initial pool of sentence available for argument introductions. The
        input needs to be valid input for :py:func:`sympy.symbols`. It is
        recommded to use sympy's :py:obj:`"p:n"` notation, where `n` refers to 
        the number of sentences. 

    :param max_sentencepool: 
        When the probability of a `"new_sentence"` event is non-zero, the 
        sentencepool is enlarged in the course of a simulation run until it 
        reaches its maximum extension. As in :py:attr:`sentencepool`, the input
        needs to be understood by :py:func:`sympy.symbols()` and should be 
        equal or greater than :py:attr:`sentencepool`. If :py:obj:`None` is 
        input, it will default to the extension of :py:attr:`sentencepool`.

    :param key_statements: 
        When a :py:obj:`"treelike"` :py:attr:`debate_growth` is selected, should
        be an iterable of inputs understood by :py:func:`sympy.symbols`. Has no
        effect when :py:obj:`"random"` :py:attr:`debate_growth` is selected. 
        These key statements will be the roots of constructed tree-like argument
        map. Needs to be a subset of elements from :py:attr:`sentencepool` and
        :py:attr:`max_sentencepool`.

        .. admonition :: Example

            A sentence pool of :py:obj:`"p:20"` includes the symbols 
            :py:obj:`p0`, :py:obj:`p1`, ..., :py:obj:`p19`. The first two items
            can be selected as roots for the argument map like this:

            >>> s = Simulation(debate_growth="treelike", sentencepool="p:20", key_statements=["p0", "p1"])

    :param parent_debate: 
        If supplied, the simulation will inherit this debate stage. Otherwise, 
        simulations are initialised with an empty debate stage.

    :param argumentlength: 
        Either an integer or an iterable of integers indicating
        the number of premises per argument. If an integer $n$
        is provided, all arguments will have $n$ premises. If
        an iterable is provided, one of its elements $e$ is 
        chosen randomly at each argument introduction, and the
        introduced arguments will receive $e$ premises.

        .. admonition :: Examples

            Arguments with exactly four premises are introduced to a 
            simulation:

            >>> s = Simulation(argumentlength=4)

            Arguments with 1â€“4 premises are introduced to this simulation:

            >>> s = Simulation(argumentlength=[1,2,3,4])

    :param positions:
        An iterable of agents participating in the debate. If not supplied, only
        random arguments can be introduced in a simulation. Other argumentation 
        strategies require at least two agents in the population.

        .. admonition:: Example

            First generate a list of 10 agents with the fortify strategy:
            
            >>> mypositions = [Position(debate=None, introduction_strategy=strategies.fortify) for _ in range(10)]

            And then use it in the Simulation initialisation:
            
            >>> s = Simulation(positions=mypositions)

    :param copy_input_positions:
        Decide whether to make a deep copy of the input :py:attr:`positions`. If 
        set to :py:obj:`False`, the input position objects will be mutated by the
        simulation run. 

    :param initial_position_size:
        If given as an integer $i$, positions will be filled up with random 
        truth-value attributions until they contain $i$ such judgements. When 
        :py:obj:`None` is selected, agents will have complete positions, i.e. 
        they will assign a truth-value to each sentence in the sentence pool.

    :param default_introduction_strategy:
        The introduction strategy for positions that have no :py:attr:`introduction_strategy`
        assigned to them.

    :param default_update_strategy:
        Specifies how agents should update their belief system in case of 
        incoherence. Two methods are implemented:
        
        - :py:obj:`"closest_coherent"`: recommended for complete positions
        - :py:obj:`"closest_closed_partial_coherent"`: recommended for partial positions

    :param int partial_neighbour_search_radius:
        A parameter for the :py:obj:`"closest_closed_partial_coherent"`. As the 
        number of partial neighbours rises exponentially when the distance
        increases, this puts an upper limit on the number of inspected possible
        positions that an agent with a partial position would move to.

    A simulation that begins with a pre-defined debate. Agents uncover arguments

    argument map generation algorithm Betz, Chekan & Mchedlidze ([Betz2021]_).
        
    :param argument_selection_strategy: Can be :py:obj:`"any"` or :py:obj:`"max"`.
        When set to :py:obj:`"any"`, a random argument is uncovered at each
        step as long as it matches the argumentation strategies' requirements.
        If :py:obj:`"max"` is selected, arguments that reach the most agents in
        the population is selected. 
        
    :param dict debate_generation: Additional settings to the initial argument map 
        generation which are passed on to :py:func:`generate_hierarchical_argument_map`.
        Note that the number of key statements and the sentencepool are provided
        in dedicated attributes :py:attr:`num_key_statements` and 
        :py:attr:`sentencepool`.
        
    :param default_update_strategy: Agents who need to update their position do
        so according to the strategy selected here. Options are 
        :py:obj:`"closest_coherent"` for complete positions and 
        :py:obj:`"closest_closed_partial_coherent"` for partial positions.

    :param initial_arguments: Start the simulation with these arguments, even
        if they are not part of the generated argument map. It is advised to 
        use the default :py:obj:`None`.
        
    :param initial_position_size: The number of belief for the initial positions.
        If set to :py:obj:`None`, will default to the length of the 
        :py:attr:`sentencepool`. If smaller than the :py:attr:`sentencepool`,
        positions will be partial and contain a random subset of sentences. 
        Positions that have no initial truth-value attributions will be randomly
        assigned.
        
    :param int num_key_statements: The number of roots for the generated 
        tree-like argument map. 
        
    :param int partial_neighbour_search_radius: An additional setting for the 
        :py:obj:`"closest_closed_partial_coherent"` updating strategy, indicating
        the neighbourhood radius that is scanned for an alternative if a position
        needs to update.
        
    :param positions: A list of initial positions, as indicated in 
        :ref:`Setting up a population`.
        
    :param sentencepool: A sentencepool, given as an iterable understood by
