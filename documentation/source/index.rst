:py:mod:`taupy` is a Python package for the study of dialectical structures. 

A dialectical structure is an abstract representation of a debate, including 
its arguments and the belief systems agents adopt in light of the arguments. 
The Greek letter tau (τ) is used in the theory of dialectical structures to 
describe its fundamental variable: A triple consisting of a set of arguments 
together with the support and defeat relations among them. 
Hence the name for this package.

.. seealso::

   Introductions to the theory of dialectical structures can be found in 
   [Betz2013]_, pp. 33–36 (recommended general introduction) and
   [Betz2009]_ (more technical, logic-oriented).  

.. hint:: 

   This package is not a debate reconstruction tool, and offer no tools for 
   visualisation. For these purposes, you could have a look at `Argdown 
   <https://argdown.org>`_.
